## The Slideshow

I kept the project pretty simple, just a basic slideshow since no specifics were given with regards to this assignment. I tried not to overengineer the project, so it's just using a couple composables, no stores, a simple api, and 4 components in Composition API.
<br><br>
Only 5 images are loaded at once in order to reduce the wait time for the api.
I thought about asynchronously loading images as you navigate photos, but decided for brevity, this would suffice.
There were no criteria given for any UI functionality, so I didn't add any interactable options for autoplay, slide wait interval for autoplay, number of photos loaded, or photo resolution. However the functionality is setup for most of these, all that's required is the UI.
<br>
I also opted to load images in a 4:3 aspect ratio for simplicity and a cleaner look.

Thanks for the opportunity and looking forward to hearing back from you,<br>Josh
